# Practicum Project 2
## Summary
This is the second version of the single-page webdite project.
You can click [here](https://github.com/oinsur/web_project_1) to see the first version of the project. In the second version of the  
project, there have been some new blocks added. This version contains some elements which were not used in the previous version of the project.  
### These consist of the following:
* animations
* iframes
* transitions  
## Layout and organization
All the sections are contained in their own blocks and some of the content is arranged within each block using the flexbox property.  
There are some text elements which are arranged in a table as well along with the use of margins, and padding. Some of the blocks  
were reused as stated in the brief, and some were modified.    

## File Management
Each block has a folder with a respective CSS file which contains the styles which are applied to that block. All stylesheets are imported  
into the index.css file. This helps to keep the stylesheet organized and also helps the html page to load faster.  

## Improvements and modifications
I have really learned alot from these two projects. I have a better understanding of how to use BEM to organize blocks and content.  
Flexbox is still something that I need to practice and use more, but I am getting a better understanding for it. I can't think of anything  
that I could improve on the page. One modification I may do is to not use a solid white background on the page. I would perhaps  
include a light gray background or perhaps even use some light gray gradients in place of a solid white bacground color.
